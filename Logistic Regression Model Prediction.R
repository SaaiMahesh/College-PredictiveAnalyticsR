#Dataset description
#M - Monetory value
#Receny - How recent was the purchase
#Florence - Book bought or not
#We can use this dataset to predict if the people have purchased the books using florence column(0,1) through logistic regression.
#GLM (Generalized linear model is inherited for Linear Model as special linear modelling for logistic regression). Here, family used to specify binomial form. We are using Florence and M as dependent and independent respectively.

#Actual values of 1 shows that people did buy the book but predicted shows 85 did not meaning that it is wrong prediction.. (A1-P0 should be lower values FALSE NEGATIVE)
