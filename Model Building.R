#Now,the adjusted R square increases, and starts to decrease the values after keeping on adding the variables.
#This is because - the fundamental point is that when you add predictors to your model, the multiple Rsquared will always increase.
#and the adjusted Rsquared controls against this increase so adjusted Rsquared will get decreased and adds penalties for the number of predictors in the model.

#Dummy variables - It used to represent categorical data (by mapping alphabetical data to numerical) and can be used for modelling. Before the data is split, dummy variables should be added if required for any categorical data that is present in the dataset.
